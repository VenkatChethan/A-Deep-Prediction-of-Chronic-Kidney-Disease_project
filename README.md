# A-Deep-Prediction-of-Chronic-Kidney-Disease_project
Overview
This project investigates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on clinical and laboratory data. Early diagnosis of CKD is critical in preventing progression to end-stage renal disease, improving patient outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs.

Features
Analysis of 25 clinical attributes to identify the most relevant subset for CKD prediction.
Implementation and evaluation of 12 supervised learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Best-performing model: XGBoost, with 98.3% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dataset
The dataset comprises features such as:

Blood Pressure
Serum Creatinine
Hemoglobin
Red Blood Cell Count
Blood Urea, and more.
Approach
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Cleaning, encoding, and scaling data.
Selecting the most impactful features using feature engineering.
Model Implementation:
Training multiple machine learning algorithms on the preprocessed dataset.
Comparing model performance to select the most accurate predictor.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Results
The XGBoost classifier emerged as the best model with superior performance across all metrics.

Tools and Technologies
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Platform: Jupyter Notebook
Role and Contribution
As the Team Leader, I managed the entire lifecycle of the project, from data preparation and model selection to evaluation and documentation.

Future Scope
Development of a web-based CKD diagnostic tool using Flask for healthcare providers.
Integration of additional clinical data and exploration of deep learning models for enhanced accuracy.
